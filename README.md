the name is a mix of "tomodachi" and "pomodoro", i'm really proud of it üëÄ

there is a "social" aspect that I want to bring to the project later on, so I am really happy with the name.

„Å®„ÇÇ„Å†„Å° "to-mo-da-chi" stands for "friend" in Japanese  
Pomodoro comes from [The Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), a time management technique developed by Francesco Cirillo. 

I made this project to learn reactJS. I hope to learn a lot from you.
